  <h4><strong>April 16, 2015</strong></h4>
  <p>We have launched an NPM (Node Package Module) command-line tool, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chui-ios">chui-ios</a>, to enable creating hybrid apps for iOS. Just run it from the terminal, provide a project name, username, and drag your ChocolateChip-UI app onto the terminal and hit return. The tool will turn your Web app into an Xcode project wrapping your app in a Web view. Double click and run or deploy to a tetthered iOS device for testing. Please note that because iOS apps require Apple's Xcode IDE to run, this tool only works on Mac OS X. Running this on Windows will not create a viable project for deployment to iOS.</p>
  <p>This tool is easy to install. just run:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
    sudo npm  install -g chui-ios</pre>
  <p>Running this will require your password, since it installs it globally. This allows you to invoke it at any time from the command-line.</p>
  <p>We are currently working on an Android version as well.</p>

  <p><figcaption>New Theme Roller</figcaption><img src="./images/news/theme-roller.png" alt=""></p>
  <p>We've update the website to make it easier for you to get to what you need. We've added a new feature, a <a href='./community.html#/themes'>theme roller</a>. Using the theme roller, you can easily customize the colors for a consistent theme. You can choose to just color text and controls, or to also color the navigation bars and toolbars. When you're done you can copy the resulting stylesheet and add it to your project.</p>

  <p>The theme roller uses the YIQ color space to determine readability of text on background colors. This is used when you choose to colorize the navigation bars and toolbars. We pass the red, green and blue channel values to the following formula to determine if we need to change the color of text on such a background:</p>

  <pre class='prettyprint'>brightness  =  sqrt( .241 R2 + .691 G2 + .068 B2 )</pre>

  <p>This means you just have to pay attention to the colors you want. The theme roller will handle giving you text with the appropriate contrast for a background color. However, if you are not colorizing the navigation bars, on iOS and Android you must be careful to not choose a color that is too light. That's your choice. The theme roller shows you your chosen Operating Systems UI with your color choice in real time so you can see if you choices work or not.</p>

  <p>You can read more about <a href="http://bit.ly/17cS7iR" target='_blank'>how we came up with our contrast formula</a> on our Tumblr blog.</p>
