<h1>Decoupling Code</h1>

<p>When using Web technologies, especially those who heavily rely on jQuery for everything, it's common to create situations with the UI and the code that runs an application are tightly bound up in what's often referred to as spaghetti code. This results in code that is hard to debug, hard to maintain and hard to extend. Decoupling is not an approach to coding to avoid tight coupling of functionalities.</p>

<p>The most common way of decoupling is through the use of observer patters. Knockout, Angular and many other frameworks use some type of observers to decouple the code. ChocolateChip-UI does not have a dedicated observer factory built-in. But it does have something close: pub/sub. Using the pub/sub methods, we can set up an evented bus that works the same as a dedicated observer system. Before we get to envoled, let's first take a look at how ChocolateChip-UI's pub/sub works.</p>

<p>There are just three methods to implement pub/sub:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$.subscribe(broadcast)</li>
  <li>$.publish(broadcast, data)</li>
  <li>$.unsubscribe(broadcast)</li>
</ol>

<p>These three methods are of course very similar to event binding. In fact, this is a custom event bus for handling the workings of an app. We first need to define a broadcast. We do this by giving it a unique name, as we may need to may a number of different broadcasts depending on what our app is doing. Let's imagine we have a list that the user taps. We want to set up a broadcast that will publish what the user chose. We can then set up any number of subscribers to react when the publication occurs. We'll name our broadcast "user-choice". Feel free to be as descriptive as you like. You can also create namespaces so that you can define channel-based broadcasts. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>'item/choose'</li>
  <li>'item/purchase'</li>
  <li>'item/reject'</li>
</ul>

<p>By using these types of namespaced broadcast names we can identify the relationship of various broadcasts. Such namespaces are useful for apps with a lot of pub/sub. But for simpler apps they are unnecessary.</p>

<p>If you've previously read the tutorial for Navigation, you will remember how we used a callback on the navigation list to do something when the user tapped a list item. We're going to do something similar here, but instead, we're only going to publish a broadcast.</p>


<pre class="prettyprint"><code>recipesList.on('singletap', 'li', function() {
  // Get the id of the tapped item:
  var recipeID = $(this).attr('id');
  // Publish the boradcast with the item id:
  $.publish("user-choice", recipeID);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we can publish a broadcast, we need to define a subscriber. There are a lot of ways to use the subscriber. It really depends on your coding style. Personally, we prefer to define the subscribers as separate blocks. Thus they effectively become mediators. The mediator pattern is a way to write code in separated blocks. It stands between the interaction that published a broadcast, and the code that will be the ultimate target of that braodcast. For example, ordinarly when the user clicks on a list item, we might want to update a shopping cart object. It's not uncommon for developers to write all that responsiblity right into the event handler for the list. This results in spaghetti code. The UI then has to know about the shopping cart in order to update it. If you need to change how the UI works, you may also need to change how you update the shopping cart. Using a mediator, we avoid this entaglement. With a subscriber/mediator, the UI need not know anything about the shopping cart object. Similarly, the shopping cart need not no anything about the UI. And both need know anything about the mediator. Finally, the mediator does need to know about the UI. It merely listens for a broadcast. When a broadcast happens and it receives the data, it exectues the actions it was defined to do. This may involve updating the shopping cart. This gives us clearly separated concerns. This is easy to understand. It also allows us to make reasonable changes to the UI or the shopping cart and only have to worry about making sure only the mediator still works. Since the medator's task is about updating the shopping cart, this should be very straightforward. So, let's look at setting up our subscriber/mediator:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>var choiceMediator = $.subscribe("user-choice", registerTheChoice);
// The callback gets to arguments passed from the subscriber,
// the broadcast topic and the data:
var registerTheChoice = function(topic, choice) {
  // We'll assume there's an shopping cart object with
  // an array of items the user chose:
  shoppingCart.items.push(choice);
};
</code></pre>

<p>What you can accomplish with pub/sub and mediators is only limited by your ingenuity. Your data model my have a publisher that annouces when something is deleted form it. You could then have a mediator for some part of the UI that would update it when this occurs.</p>

<p>Lest we forget, there is also the <code>$.unsubscribe(broadcast)</code> method. This allows you to unsubscribe at any time from a broadcast. You might want to to this after a certain state has been reached. To unsubscribe a mediator from a broadcast, just pass the broadcast as an argument.</p>

<h3>Data Binding</h3>
<p>Many frameworks provide data binding. They normally do this with observers. This can often be costly for your application because the more things you bind, the more memory gets eaten up by the observers. This can result in terrible performance issues. ChocolateChip-UI provides a way to implement one way data binding using two attributes: <code>data-controller</code> and <code>data-model</code>. By giving these two attributes the same value, we indicate that they have a bound relationship. At load time, ChocolateChip-UI sees this and automatically creates a mediator using its pub/sub system to establish the binding. This is much more efficient than Knockout or Angular. Here's an example of how easy this is:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;ul class="list"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;lable&gt;Enter data:&lt;/lable&gt; 
    &lt;input id='myText' data-controller='input-value' type='text'&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 data-model='input-value'&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Because the input and the label both have a controller and model with the same value, "input-value", when the user enters text in the input, the label will update automatically. In the background, ChocolateChip-UI creates  a publisher on the input that sends a broadcast called "data-binding-user-value" and it creates a subscriber for the label that listens for that broadcast. When the broadcast happens, the label updates its value. It's important to understand how this differs from other approaches. Often other frameworks create a persistent object in memory when you define data binding, and the observer object updates the data between it and whatever else is bound to it. In contrast, ChocolateChip only establishes a pub/sub stub that creates the bound relationship. When a broadcast is published and received by the subscriber, it ends and whatever memory that data took up gets garbage collected.</p>

<h3>Two-way Data Binding</h3>
<p>ChocolateChip-UI does not provide two-way data binding. When used improperly, two-way data binding can result in circular references that are hard to troubleshoot. However, it is possible to create two-way data binding using our pub/sub techniques. To do so, just define another mediator whose puspose is to update the data value in the opposite direction when needed. The data binding example create when you build ChocolateChip-UI actually has an example of two-way data binding implemented. However, you will have to open the browser's console to see it in action. There's a data model object defined in the example. Then the example creates and instance with the code:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>var myText = new InputTextModel();
</code></pre>

<p>Change that to:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>$.myText = new InputTextModel();
</code></pre>

<p>Now, because "myText" is on the global jQuery object, you can access it from the console. The data object has a getter and setter. This allows you to see what it's current value is from the console by running:</p>


<pre class="prettyprint"><code>$.myText.get();
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, you can set the value of the data object from the console by running:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>$.myText.set("The new value here!");
</code></pre>

<p>When you first load this data binding example with the "$.myText" global variable, you will notice that when you enter a value in the first input and run <code>$.myText.get()</code>, this returns the value you just entered in the input. Also, because the label is bound to the input, it also has the same value. But now, if you run <code>$.myText.set("The new value here!")</code>, you not only update the model, but also the value of the input and the label. This is two-way data binding.</p>

<p>So how did we implement this? We put a publisher in the objects setter. Therefore whenever you use that setter to change the value of the model, it publishes the same same broadcast as the input's publisher, resulting in the input and label getting updated. Please run the data binding example in your browser and check out how this simle technique provides the power of data binding. Here's the complete data object:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>var InputTextModel = function() {
  // Data is a simple string:
  var private_data = null;
  var $this = this;
  $.subscribe('data-binding-input-value', function(event, data) {
    private_data = data;
  });
  this.get = function() {
    return private_data;
  };
  
  // Use this method to set the value
  // of this object from anywhere
  // at any time.
  //==================================
  this.set = function(data) {
    // Publish 'update-input-value' to notify
    // that model was updated. This publication
    // can be used by outside code to update
    // the private value of this model.
    //=========================================
    $.publish('data-binding-input-value', data);
    // Publish '' to inform input that
    // model was updated and what its
    // new value is.
    //================================
    $.publish('update-input-value', data);
  };
};
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the data model's setter publishes two broadcasts: one to update the label and one to update the input. You can test this out and examine the code by running the file "data-binding.html" in the examples folder after building ChocolateChip-UI.</p>
