<h1>Hybrid Apps</h1>

<p>Most people want to use ChocolateChip-UI to make hybrid apps. Since ChocolateChip-UI provides themes for iOS, Android and Windows Phone, those are the three targets for hybrid apps.</p>

<h3>iOS</h3>

<p>Because of restrictions by Apple, you need to be on a Mac to make and test a hybrid app for iOS. You can easily use Xcode to create a Web View for your hybrid app. We have this process documented in the following <a href='http://wobbabits.tumblr.com/post/107524782642/creating-a-hybrid-app-for-ios' target='_blank'> blog post</a>. But rather than following that route, we've create an NPM module to make this easier. Just run a command line tool that creates the project for you. Here's how.</p>

<h4>NPM</h4>

<p>On your Mac, open the terminal and run the following command:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>sudo npm install -g chui-ios
</code></pre>
<p>This will install our NPM module globally so that it's always available to run at all times. When you run this, you will need to enter the user password for your computer. After this is instalaled, you can run it in your terminal. Try running the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>chui-ios
</code></pre>

<p>You should see the following returned:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>$: chui-ios
Usage: --proj "myApp" --username "Joe" --chuiapp "~/Documents/myWebApp"

Options:
  --proj                                                              [required]
  --username                                                          [required]

Missing required arguments: proj, username
</code></pre>

<p><code>chui-ios</code> accepts four arguments (the double hyphens are required):</p>
<ul>
  <li>--proj (the name of your project) </li>
  <li>--username (your username on your computer)</li>
  <li>--chuiapp (path to an existing ChUI Web app, otherwise it will create a default html page)</li>
  <li>--appicons (path of icons for the hybrid path)</li>
</ul>


<p>To successfully create a project with this command line tool, you'll need to give your project a name, a single word name is best, and your username, that is, the name you use on your computer. Xcode needs to know what your username is so that it can find the frameworks it needs in your computer's file system. Not providing the username you use on your computer can result in a non-functional Xcode project.</p>

<p>Adding the paths to an existing Web app and its icons is easy, type the argument name first, followed by a space. Then drage the folder on to the terminal. The path to that folder will appear after the argument. Here an example of how this command might look:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>chui-ios --proj "Hamburger" --username "Wimpy" --chuiapp /Users/bombo/Documents/hamburger --appicons /Users/bombo/Desktop/hambuger-icons
</code></pre>

<p>Hitting "Return" will execute this command, resulting in an excode project created on the desktop with the name Hamburger. Inside you would find normal Xcode files, a folder called Website with your Web app files inside, and your icons, iTunes are and launch images already in place in Xcode. Double click the Xcode project icon will launch Xcode. Once that is done you can immediate run the project on the simulator, or directly on a tethered iPhone.</p>

<p>You can find out more about this <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/chui-ios' target='_blank'>NPM module</a> for iOS hybrid apps on NPM.</p>

<h3>Windows Phone</h3>

<p>Making a hybrid app for Windows is so simple that we cannot even consider wasting time creating a command line tool for that. Microsoft has made this really easy using Visual Studio. If you already have Visual Studio, you are ready to go, otherwise, we recommend you download <a href='https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs' target='_blank'> Visual Studio Community Edition</a>. It's completely free.</p>
<p>Once you have Visual Studio installed, open it. Click "New Project...". Open the Visual C# tree of templates in the right side column of available templates. Then select "Store Apps" and "Windows Phone App and choose "WebView App (Windows Phone) in the center screen. Then click OK. This will create your WebView project. The resulting project will have a folder call Assets. These are your icons, etc. Replace these with replacements using your own artwork. There is also a folder called HTML. This is where your app goes. You can literally just copy and replace whatever is in there with your Web app. Just make sure your app's main file is called "index.html". After that, you're ready to run. You can read more a more detailed explanation on <a href='http://wobbabits.tumblr.com/post/108276823682/creating-a-hybrid-app-for-windows-phone-8' target='_blank'>our blog</a>.</p>

<h3>Android</h3>

<p>You can install the NPM package to enable creating hybrid apps for Android. This command-line tool works on Mac OS X and Windows.</p>

<h4>Mac Install</h4>

<p>Open the terminal and enter:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>sudo npm install -g chui-android
</code></pre>

<p>After hitting return, you will be prompted to enter your password. When it is done you are ready to start creating Android hybrid apps. This does have two dependencies: Orancle's <a href='http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html' target='_blank'>Java</a> and Google's <a href='https://developer.android.com/tools/help/index.html' target='_blank'>Android Studio</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>chui-android</code> command-line tool can accept four arguments. The first to are required:</p>

<ul>
<li>--proj (the name for your app)</li>
<li>--user (your username)</li>
<li>--app (path to your ChUI Web app - this is optional)</li>
<li>--icons (path to a folder of your app's Android icons - this is optional)</li> 
</ul>

<p>If you run <code>chui-android</code> in the terminal, you will see:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>$: chui-ios
Usage: --proj "myApp" --username "Joe" --chuiapp "~/Documents/myWebApp"

Options:
  --proj                                                              [required]
  --username                                                          [required]

Missing required arguments: proj, username
</code></pre>

<p>If you leave out <code>--app</code> or <code>--icons</code>, the package will create a default Web page that the project will load and default icons. You can simply replace these at a later time with your final assets. When the command is finished, you will find a folder with your project's name on your desktop.</p>

<p>Open Android Studio and import your project into it. After that you'll be able to run it in the emulolator or deploy it directly to a tethered device.</p>

<h4>Windows Install</h4>


<p>Open the command prompt and enter:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>npm install -g chui-android
</code></pre>

<p>When the install is done you'll be ready to create an Android app. This does have two dependencies: Orancle's <a href='http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html' target='_blank'>Java</a> and Google's <a href='https://developer.android.com/tools/help/index.html' target='_blank'>Android Studio</a>.</p></p>

  --username                                                          [required]
