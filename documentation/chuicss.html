<h2>OS-Specific Themes</h2>

<p>ChocolateChip-UI solves the problem of cross-platform app development by using themes to change the look and feel of an app to match the operating system it is running on. Because a theme is just CSS, it is easy to modify or extend a theme by adding new classes that you can use with existing widgets. If you are good with JavaScript, you might even craft your own widgets and style them with new styles. You can add the new styles to each theme.</p>

<h2>Customize Your Theme</h2>

<p>ChocolateChip-UI uses LESS to define the CSS styles. Just look for the file "colors.less" in side each theme folder in the source code. The theme LESS can be found at "src/theme." At the start of colors.less you'll find this: <code>@appTint: #81cfeb;</code>. By changing that color value and reprocessing the LESS you'll get a theme with a different accent color from the default. Remember to change this value in the colors.less file for all three themes for consistency.</p>

<h3>Use the Online Theme Roller</h3>

<p>If dealing with LESS is intimidating (yeah, we know it is), you can use our <a target="_blank" href="./community.html#/themes">online theme roller</a> to add color to your app's theme. You can choose how to colorize your app. You can just colorize some prominent text and input features. You can also choose to have a second, complimentary color. If you really want to give your app some prominent color, you can choose to colorize the navigation and toolbars. The theme roller will automatically make sure that all text is readable–dark text on light colors, light text on dark colors. The theme roller has algorithms to determine the readability of text on all possible background colors.</p>
