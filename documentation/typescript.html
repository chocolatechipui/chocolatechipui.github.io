<h1>TypeScript</h1>

<p>ChocolateChip-UI includes TypeScript declaration files. These can be identified by their endings: "d.ts". We are including these to enable support for intellisense and code completion in a wide range of text editors: Sublime Text, Atom, Visual Studio Code, Webstorm, etc. These use various plugins to enable TypeScript:</p>

<p>For Sublime Text, open the package manager, type install, then type "Best TypeScript" and hit Return. This package is created and maintained by Microsoft.</p>

<p>For Atom, use the <code>amp</code> command line tool to install:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'><code>apm install atom-typescript
</code></pre>

<p>For Visual Studio Code, TypeScript support is built in. For most editors you will need to put a reference to the TypeScript declaration files in your JavaScript. You do this by placing a referene comment at the top of your script. Notice the three slashes. These are required:</p>

<pre class="prettypring"><code>/// &lt;reference path="typings/jquery/jquery.d.ts" /&gt;
/// &lt;reference path="typings/chui/chui.d.ts" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using ChocolateChipJS instead of jQuery, then use the following:</p>

<pre class="prettypring"><code>/// &lt;reference path="typings/chocolatechip/chocolatechip.d.ts" /&gt;
/// &lt;reference path="typings/chui/chui.d.ts" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you change the path to where your typings are stored, you'll need to update the path in the reference comments to reflect this.</p>

<p>Some of the features these editors offer is popup information about methods and the arguments they use, type checking as you enter arguments for methods, code completion. Please consult the documentation for the package you're using for your code editor to find out all the supported features and keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>, you do not need to write your code in typescript to take advantage of</p>
